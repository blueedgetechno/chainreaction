# Chain Reaction 💥

> *"One dot to rule them all... until it explodes and takes everything with it."*

A ridiculously addictive **strategy board game** for Android — tap to place dots, watch cells go **BOOM** 💣, steal your friends' territory, and be the last player standing. Simple to learn, impossible to put down.

Built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material 3** — because even explosions deserve good design.


## 🎮 How It Works

It's deceptively simple:

1. **Tap** a cell to place a dot
2. Each cell has a **critical mass** (corners = 2, edges = 3, middle = 4)

3. Hit critical mass? **💥 BOOM** — dots fly to neighbors and turn them your color

</p>

4. Those neighbors might explode too... and those neighbors... and *those* neighbors...
5. One tap can flip the **entire board**. Last player alive wins!
